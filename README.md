# vault-api
	This api is a vault to store auth keys which are used to connect with external systems


## Notes
- __database:__ Vault-api uses `in-memory` database, which gets destroyed when application stops
- __auth:__ our performant event system makes writing apps easy
- __small api:__ with only 6 methods there's not much to learn
- __minimal tooling:__ built for the cutting edge `browserify` compiler
- __isomorphic:__ renders seamlessly in both Node and browsers
- __very cute:__ choo choo!
